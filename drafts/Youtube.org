The easiest way to use Youtube on Android is through Firefox mobile.

These open APIs (and such) allow different methods of access, making a more convenient user experience.
- Browsers were made for playing/viewing convenience.

There's a reason you can't embed HBO Max in a discord message.

Those same APIs are what enable youtube-dl.

Would something like Youtube ever be locked down?

Locking down YT to proprietary access would mean hell for the integrations that spread Youtube videos (Discord, WhatsApp, FB Messenger)
