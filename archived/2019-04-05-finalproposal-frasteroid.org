For our final project, we've decided to build a fraction game in the "learn to
type" style.

I remember playing typing games in 3rd-4th grade. Words (or some combination of
letters) would appear on incoming objects, and you'd have to type that
combination to destroy them before they hit you, crossed a line, etc.

The plan is a game in the same style, but the asteroids flying at your ship have
fraction problems on them. You may need to convert them to mixed numbers, or
maybe mixed numbers back to fractions. We could incorporate other fractional
aspects too, such as addition.

Development will be done on GitHub: [[https://github.com/jibby0/IGME582-final]]

Our team is the same as it was for [[/teamproposal-Analysis-of-Krita/][Commarch]]:
