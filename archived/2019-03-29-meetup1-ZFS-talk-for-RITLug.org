#+TITLE: meetup1: ZFS talk for RITLug
#+TAGS: hfoss

Just before spring break, I gave a talk at RITlug on the best filesystem in the
history of filesystems: ZFS.

While that /might/ be an opinion, it's certainly cool, and worth talking about!
There's a lot ZFS can do, and a reason it's sweeping server environments.

I covered the history of ZFS, the features it provides, and some example
commands to get started, and plenty of resources to check out! You can check it
out on [[https://ritlug.com/talks/2019/03/07/w8-zfs/][RITlug's website]].

** TLDR

ZFS is a copy-on-write (COW) filesystem: every time it writes data, it writes it
to a new place, rather than overwriting. The new location for the updated data
is written, and all is well. While that sounds a bit wasteful, it means old data
can be saved without any cost: just don't throw away the old location when you
write! ZFS tracks these old copies, called snapshots, and lets you jump back to
them at a later date, or access any data they hold.

It's great to take a snapshot (quickly!) before a system upgrade, and roll back
if anything breaks.

ZFS has many more ‚Äúmodern‚Äù features: supporting huge amounts of data, verifying
its integrity, compressing it before writing to disk, deduplication, and many
others!

** All talk

I enjoy giving talks. Not only can I (hopefully) help break down a complicated
subject into bite-sized pieces, but presentation prep teaches me a lot about a
subject! It's also a chance to improve my public speaking and social skills. üôÇ
